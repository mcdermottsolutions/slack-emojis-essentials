to be used in conjunction with https://github.com/lambtron/emojipacks/

i always use https://github.com/lambtron/emojipacks/ when i start a new slack channel but uploading each pack individually is a pain.  so i use the all.yaml file here to just upload them all at once.  after that i epic-essentials-slack-emoji-collection.yaml file to add extras.  actually last time i tried i had trouble using the essentials file and uploaded them individually.  but i shall include that here for now untested to try again soon.
